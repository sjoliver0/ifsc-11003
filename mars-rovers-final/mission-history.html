            <h4>Spirit & Opportunity (MER)</h4>
            <p>Spirit launched June 10, 2003, and landed on Mars January 4, 2004, at Gusev Crater. Opportunity launched July 7, 2003, and landed January 25, 2004, at Meridiani Planum. The twin rovers were designed to search for evidence of past water and greatly exceeded their planned 90-sol lifetimes. <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA MER</a>.</p>

            <p>Curiosity launched November 26, 2011, and landed on August 6, 2012, in Gale Crater (Aeolis Palus / Bradbury Landing). Its mission objective was to determine whether Mars ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life. <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA Curiosity</a>.</p>

The rover searches for signs of ancient microbial life, collects and caches samples for potential return to Earth, and demonstrates technologies (for example, the MOXIE oxygen-production experiment and the Ingenuity helicopter). <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA Perseverance</a>.</p>

        <h4>Curiosity — Mission overview</h4>
        <p><strong>Official objective:</strong> To determine whether Mars ever had environmental conditions favorable for microbial life — including an investigation of the role of water and planetary habitability in preparation for human exploration. Curiosity uses a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG) for continuous electrical power. <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA Curiosity</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Major discoveries:</strong> Chemical and mineral evidence of ancient habitable environments, detection of organic molecules in rocks, and detailed stratigraphy of Gale Crater's ancient lake and river deposits.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="perseverance" class="mission-detail">
        <h4>Perseverance — Mission overview</h4>
        <p><strong>Official objectives:</strong> Study Mars' ancient habitability, seek signs of ancient life, collect and cache samples for possible future return to Earth, and advance technologies to support eventual human exploration (MOXIE, terrain-relative navigation, Ingenuity helicopter demonstration). <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA Perseverance</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Major accomplishments:</strong> Successful deployment of the Ingenuity helicopter (first powered flight on another planet) and systematic caching of rock cores in sealed tubes for future sample-return missions.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="mer-rovers" class="mission-detail">
        <h4>Spirit & Opportunity — Mission overview</h4>
        <p><strong>Official objectives:</strong> Characterize the geology and search for signs that water was present in Mars' past. Both rovers were solar powered and used rocker-bogie suspension to traverse rough terrain. Each mission dramatically exceeded its planned duration — delivering years of data about past watery environments. <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA MER</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Major accomplishments:</strong> Discovery of sedimentary rocks and minerals (for example, hematite and sulfates) indicating past aqueous environments and a more complex climatic history than previously known.</p>
